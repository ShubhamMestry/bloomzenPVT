        <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed

          system resources and memory.</p>
        <h2>why c++ programming language? </h2>
        <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ can be found in today's operating systems,
          Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a
          clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can
          be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++ is fun and easy to learn! As
          C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa
        </p>
        <h2>how c++ programming language works? </h2>
        <p>The purpose of C++ compilers is to read programs and convert it into object code. Compilers are simply
          programs that work through command-line interfaces, also known as CLIs. When compilers convert your program's
          code into object code, it's merely translating it so the computer can execute it directly.</p>

        <h2> what is .Net MVC?</h2>
        <p>MVC is a design pattern used to decouple user-interface (view), data (model), and application logic (controller). This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using the MVC pattern for websites, requests are routed to a Controller that is responsible for working with the Model to perform actions and/or retrieve data. The Controller chooses the View to display and provides it with the Model. The View renders the final page, based on the data in the Model.</p>

        <p>
          CodeIgniter is an MVC framework. MVC stands for Model View Controller. When a user requests a resource, the controller responds first. The controller understands the user request then request the necessary data if necessary. For example, if you want to retrieve a customer with the id= 3, the controller will receive your request, then request the CodeIgniter models to retrieve the record with the id of 3. The CodeIgniter models will return the record to the controller. The controller then forwards the result to the view which formats it into a human-readable format. Then the results are returned to the user in the browser.

Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears.
